![]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/1.png)![1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/1.png)




World Wide Web (WWW) has become a crucial part of our day-to-day life. We cannot think of a single day without it. Using the internet, We can get all the necessary resources that we need for our everyday activities.



We get all web resources through websites or web pages. the architecture of any website or web page consists of two inevitable parts and these are 1. Front-End or Client-Side and 2. Back-End or Server-Side web development. 
Front-End or Client-Side is the part of a website or webpage that the user can interact with. On the other hand, the Back-End or Server-Side of a website is the part that is used to store the raw data, databases, code, or syntax to perform the desired functions on the Front-End. The raw data from the Back-End or Server-Side turns into the graphical user interfaces and webpages via Html, CSS, and Javascript.



The combination of both the Front-End (Client-Side) and Back-End (Server-Side) is known as full-stack web development and the engineers or developers are proficient in both Front-End (Client-Side) and Back-End (Server-Side) are called full-stack web developers. A Front-End developer may only know Front-End technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Angular, VueJS, etc while a Back-End developer has to be efficient at Back-End technologies such as PHP, NodeJS, Django, Spring (a Java Framework for Back-End), and so on. But a full-stack developer needs to be a master at all of the above-mentioned technologies or a complete framework that can be used for both Front-end and Back-End such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, etc. 



Now let's discuss how to be a full-stack web developer and what programming languages, frameworks or technologies should be learned for being a magnificent full-stack web developer.



First of all, let's start with the Front-End or Client-Side development.

**1.HTML**

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. To access any webpage, we need web browsers and HTML is the markup language that helps the browsers to display the raw data from Back-End. So it is needless to say, learning HTML is the initial part of a full-stack web developer. HTML is quite easy and there are plenty of resources and tutorials to learn HTML for free of cost.





**2.CSS**

Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is the technology that brings the colourfulness and beautifulness of a webpage. All the HTML elements can be styled and modified by CSS. CSS can be added to HTML both internally and externally or both at the same time. The overall graphical interface of a webpage is designed by CSS. CSS brought a revolution into the world wide web (WWW) as it increases the level of the browsing experience.





**3. Bootstrap**

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework specially designed for responsive and mobile-friendly web pages. With Bootstrap, simple but user-friendly layouts, navigation, buttons, forms, etc can be designed with less quantity of syntax. Actually bootstrap works like a magic. Bootstrap helps save developers' time and effort and it adds some extra beauty with just a few lines of code. For a responsive and modern look-like webpage, bootstrap is a must-learn skill. Maintained by Twitter, bootstrap revolutionized the responsiveness of a website on different types and sizes of devices such as mobile, tab, and pc.





**4. Javascript**

Javascript controls how a website should behave. the overall behavioural and functional activities of a web page are coded by the means of javascript. Let's give some examples of how javascript works on websites- whenever we visit websites, we often find some notifications about cookies. These notifications contain two or more buttons (two buttons in most cases). One button is for "Accept Cookies" and another one is for "Cancel" or "Setting Cookies". Now both of the buttons have the functional task. Each of the buttons consists of on-click function where the functionality and activities of the buttons get instructed. So this is just a simple instance of how javascript works on a dynamic website.






So learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript is a fundamental procedure of front-end development but one can expect that he/she can build some static or dynamic front-end part of a website using these technologies.

Now let's explore some popular and widely used back-end or server-side technologies.

**1. Javascript**

It is not surprising that javascript can be used for both front-end and back-end. due to this multi-tasking, javascript is one of the most popular programming languages and developers with excellent skills in javascript never regret it as javascript can be used for multiple types of applications such as web, desktop, and mobile applications. Javascript can be an ideal programming language for developers who want to be full-stack web developers as javascript provides features and functionalities for front-end and back-end development.






**2.PHP**

PHP is another popular scripting language ideal for web development. PHP is one of the most widely-used back-end languages and till now it has been dominating because of its flexible and fast features. For server-side or client-side development, PHP can be a smart choice. A framework called Laravel is an extremely popular web framework from PHP. PHP is very popular among developers because PHP allows developers to build powerful functions with less syntax especially for connecting web applications with databases other complex applications. PHP can be used for numerous types of applications but it is most popular for back-end or server-side technology.





**3. Python**

Python is one of the easiest and most popular programming languages. Python is widely used for desktop applications, web applications, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data visualization, etc. Python provides some powerful but easy-to-use back-end frameworks that make the developers' task even easier to build a web application without much tedious. Django and Flask are two common and popular python web frameworks for back-end or server-side applications.




**4. C#**

C# or C sharp is the most used programming language for the .NET framework. Developers who have minimal knowledge of java or C++ will find C# very familiar and this familiarity will aid the developers to acquire C# more easily. ASP.NET is one of the most powerful and widely-used frameworks for back-end web development and C# is the language that is used by maximum numbers of ASP.NET developers. So if anyone wants to build a career as a .NET developer, he/she can learn C# for back-end as well because C# developers are always in high demand.





**5.Java**

Java is a pure object-oriented programming language. Java is one of the most classic and popular programming languages because java allows a mechanism called WORA or write once and run anywhere. this mechanism makes java a cross-platform programming language. Spring boot is a well-known and popular java framework that can be used for back-end web applications.



above, only five of many programming languages are discussed. these five programming languages are nearly common for back-end web applications and that is why these five programming languages are mentioned. Note that there are plenty of languages and frameworks for web applications. Mentioning or discussing all of them is beyond this blog.

Till now, we discussed some common languages for front-end and back-end. Now let's explore some libraries and frameworks that are used to make web applications modern and user-friendly.

**1.	React**

React is a popular javascript library for front-end web applications. React is a lightweight but powerful javascript library especially used for single-page websites. With the basic knowledge of javascript, anyone can start learning to react. JSX or javascript syntax extension allows writing javascript and HTML at the same time. Another feature that makes react special is hot module reloading which gives an advantage to changing the current element without refreshing the entire application.





**2. AngularJS**

A javascript-based framework specially used for front-end web applications. AngularJS offers a responsive and user-friendly user interface that makes a web application more attractive. Javascript developers can easily learn and master AngularJS as it's written on javascript. Like ReactJs, AngularJS is widely used for single-page web applications. Using AngularJS is easy and fun as it can be added to an HTML page with **"script"** tag. AngularJS developers can expect a high salary job as demands for AngularJS developers are increasing day by day.





**3.Vue.JS**

Another javascript framework for front-end web applications is especially used for single-page websites. The most crucial thing that makes VueJS special is that it is
fast, flexible, and easy to implement. Unlike AngularJs and ReactJs, VueJS is ideal for small and simple web applications. for a simple, user-friendly, and interactive user interface, VueJS can be a perfect framework.





**4.ASP.NET**

ASP.NET is a powerful and popular framework for both front-end and back-end web applications. Along with back-end features, ASP.NET allows using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap for the front-end side of the web applications. ASP.NET is a perfect framework for building complete web applications because it supports all the features that are needed to build a complete website. C# is the commonly used programming language for the ASP.NET framework. ASP.NET can work with various types of databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, MySQL, and Oracle. MVC or Model-View-Controller approach is one crucial reason that makes ASP.NET unique and popular. The Code-First entity framework of MVC lets the developers code the project first without creating prior databases, and through migration, databases according to the data of model classes can be created. This approach saves time and effort for developers as the databases are only created when the necessary classes with required properties are declared.






**5. Django**

Django is a Python-based web framework for back-end web applications. Python is one of the easiest programming languages and Django is designed for flexible, maintainable, and fast web applications. To make the website reliable and secure, using the Django framework can be a smart choice. Django supports two common databases to work such as PostgreSQL and MariaDB. Using the Django framework, developers can reuse the code from other projects because it has some libraries for reusable tools, features, and apps. Django is very popular among developers and some popular sites such as Instagram, and Pinterest used the Django framework for the back end. So anyone who is planning to learn Django will not regret it.





**6. Laravel**

Laravel is a free and open-source PHP-based web framework for back-end web applications. Laravel provides back-end functionalities that help developers to create web apps without many complexities. Laravel allows users to create complex functions such as authentication, authorization, caching, etc with huge ease and a minimum amount of code. Using Laravel, developers can make effective APIs to transfer raw data to the front-end side. Another usefulness of using Laravel is that connecting to the database using Laravel is much simpler and hassle-free.





To be a full-stack web developer, having efficient knowledge and skills in the database is mandatory. Till now, only front-end and back-end technologies are discussed. As we need to store the required data of the applications, we need to know the proper instruction for keeping these data in databases. A database management system (DBMS) is a functional way of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from the database. 
Now let's discuss some popular database options for web applications

**1.	MySQL**

Till now, MySQL is a popular and widely-used database management system. Maintained by Oracle, MySQL is an open-source and relational database management system (RDBMS). Most of the active web applications have been using MySQL as their database management system. MySQL is easy to learn and simple to implement and it is ideal for beginner-level web developers.




**2. Microsoft SQL Server**

Microsoft SQL Server is one of the popular database management systems. .NET developers find Microsoft SQL Server handier for their applications development.



**3.MongoDB**

MongoDB is a NoSQL-based database management system that is also one of the popular databases for web applications. As MongoDB is a document-oriented database system, developers can manage their document data without facing that hassle. Using MongoDB can be a smart choice for a database management system because it allows developers to create multiple databases with various fields of data structure.




**4.PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is an open-source and relational database management system widely used for both mobile and web application development. PostgreSQL is very easy to learn and simple to implement as well. So developers can use the PostgreSQL database for their applications.




To Sum up, technologies for front-end, back-end, and databases are discussed here briefly, and there may be plenty of ways to learn full-stack web development and it is beyond the scope of this blog to discuss all of them. Remember, technologies have been advancing every day and it is recommended to learn new skills and technologies for being  impeccable full-stack web developer. To cope with the revolutionized advancement of the technologies, developers have to keep learning and sharpening skills continuously.
